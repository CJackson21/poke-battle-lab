# poke-battle-lab

- This project is going to calculate the odds of a pokemon team winning against a gym leader, elite 4 member, or champion of any given pokemon game
- The pokemon team will be fully customizable in terms of moves and stats
   - This also means that the moves and stats will have to be within the legal limit for that pokemon.
   - It will also implement monte carlo pi in order to do battle simulations and determine the odds of your team winning
   - stretch goals: use a machine learning model to determine odds and compare statistics with monte carlo implementation
